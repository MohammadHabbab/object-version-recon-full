# Object Versioning Reconstruction - frontend

## Introduction

This is the frontend for the object versioning reconstruction app (for more information about the whole project, see [here](https://github.com/RenchChua/object-version-recon-back)).

## "Deploying" the frontend

Even though the frontend is deployed through gh-pages, it isn't able to post anything to localhost. But if both the frontend and backend are running on localhost, then the app works.

Here are the steps to "deploy" the frontend:

 - Clone this repo onto local
 - Install the node packages by typing "npm install"
 - start the front end by typing "npm start"
 - run the frontend on localhost:3000

Make sure that you have the backend up and running on local too!
